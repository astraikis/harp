# Harp

Harp is a statically typed, memory safe hobby programming language. Its interpreter is written in Go with minimal dependencies.

I'm working on this project after finishing the tree-walk interpreter section of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom. As such, my interpreter is pretty similar. The main difference between Harp and Lox is that Harp is statically typed. I'd also like to really expand on the standard library and error reporting.

Once I finish the book, I'd like to come back and make a bytecode virtual machine like clox.
